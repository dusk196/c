# C
Well, I found some C codes back from my school days (2010) and let's not waste some good code rotting on a HDD, eh? ðŸ˜œ Could be helpful for someone searching! ðŸ˜Ž Enjoy...

FYI, I don't remember the compiler I used. I might have used either Borland C++(https://www.cprogramming.com/borland.html) or Dev C++ (https://bloodshed.net/)
